(The code for this project is private. This is just a public version to showcase our device)

This project is the collaborative work of interns from Zebra, Taiwan 2022. The purpose of this project is to design a multifeature device that is used in a warehouse setting. 
This device includes features such as but not limited to barcode scanning, route planning, navigating, and picture capturing. 
On top of the above mentioned core features, the biggest attraction of our device is that the user interface can be projected onto the floor (hence, the "P" word in our device name). This allows the users to continue their work without occupying their hands.
